Stop telling people more than they need to know.
How beautiful is to find someone who asks for nothing but your company.
Always love your friends from your heart not from your need or mood.
If you expect something in return for being a nice person , you aren't a nice person.
Whatever comes , let it come.what stays , let it stay.What goes let it go.
Maturity is when you undestand life is all about realizations.BUT NOT EXPECTATIONS!!.
